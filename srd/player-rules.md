# Player Rules

## How to Play

First, the Game Master (GM) describes your situation; second, you describe what action you take; third, the GM describes what happens. Repeat. If the action you want to take is risky, the GM establishes the stakes and sets a target number based on the difficulty and whether you have a relevant scar or skill.

|            |             |              |             |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
|            | **Scarred** | **Standard** | **Skilled** |
| **Easy**   | 8+          | 6+           | 4+          |
| **Normal** | 10+         | 8+           | 6+          |
| **Hard**   | 12+         | 10+          | 8+          |

To commit to your action, roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice). If the total result is greater than or equal to the target number, you succeed; otherwise, you fail.

## How to Fight

Each round, first each enemy gets a turn, then each player. To take a turn before the first round, succeed on a roll (as above) or surprise the enemies.

On your turn, you can move up to ~30 feet and take one action. To attack, roll 2d6 and ignore dice that roll a 4, 5, or 6; the sum of the remaining dice is the damage you deal to your target. If your target is weak to your attack, roll 4d6 instead; if they are resistant, roll 1d6; if they are immune, roll 0d6.

## Damage and Recovery

When you take damage, you lose that much HP. If you run out of HP, you die – to continue, make a new character – or, if everyone agrees your death would be unfair or unfun, you fall unconscious and gain an appropriate scar.

A good long rest restores you to your maximum HP. Up to twice per day, you can take a short rest to regain up to half your maximum HP, rounded down.

## Spellcasting

To cast a spell, roll a number of d6 equal to the number of spells you know and take the highest die to determine the spell’s potency. On a 1, something goes horribly wrong; on a 6, you do something amazing! On a 4 or more, you cannot cast the same spell again until you get a good long rest.
