# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q1: What weapons do I get?
Choose either melee weapon listed after your kind. You also get the ranged weapon listed; don’t bother tracking spent ammunition.

## Q2: What else do I start with?
Plenty of torches, food, and water. By default, armor is purely cosmetic, so you can imagine your character wearing any armor you like.

## Q3: Why do some spells have two words in brackets? Why are skills so specific?
Choose either word when you learn the spell. Thief and ranger skills transfer to similar tasks outside the city or the woods, respectively.

## Q4: How does rolling initiative work?
The GM sets a target number for the group, modified for those with relevant scars/skills. Then, each player rolls 2d6. If you succeed, you get to take a turn before the first round.

## Q5: Why do attack rolls ignore 4 to 6?
When you ignore 4 to 6, Xd6 deal X damage on average, but could deal up to 3X damage. Attacks are both predictable and surprising!

## Q6: What is an “appropriate scar?”
A scar can be any reasonable consequence that would make certain rolls more difficult, from “Anxious” to “Deafened” to “Lost arm.”

## Q7: What counts as a “short” or “good long” rest? How long do rests take?
Such terms are deliberately left vague so that the GM can adapt these rules to any scenario.

## Q8: How should I write a statblock?
“Name. HP, weapon (attacks x damage Tags). More details.” For example: “Dragon. 32 HP, claws (2x3) or fire breath (6 heavy blast).”

## Q9: How much damage should a trap or other environmental hazard deal?
If it doesn’t outright kill you, it deals 2 (weak), 4 (normal), or 6 (strong) damage.
