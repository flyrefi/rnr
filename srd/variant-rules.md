# Variant Rules

What follows are optional rules that could not be fit into the game's PDF but might improve the game for certain tables.

## V1: Faster Combat

On your side’s turn, roll everyone’s attack dice all at once, then assign each die to a target.

## V2: Combat Maneuvers

A maneuver is any reasonable combat stunt such as a shove, disarm, or trip. When you attempt a maneuver, the GM rolls 2d6; if the result is greater than or equal to your maximum HP, your target resists. Otherwise, you succeed.

If you attack with a melee weapon and deal 0 damage, you can immediately attempt a maneuver, but if your target resists, you may suffer consequences.

## V3: Armor Rules

When you run out of HP, roll 2d6; on a 10 or more, you merely fall prone for 1 minute. Otherwise, you die. Armor raises your chance to survive at 0 HP: light to 8+, medium to 6+, and heavy to 4+. You can break a shield to negate one blow.
