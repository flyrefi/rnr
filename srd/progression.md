# Progression

## Advancement

Decide your characterâ€™s goal in conversation with the GM and other players. For example:

1.	**Ambition**. Win fame and glory!
2.	**Curiosity**. Learn about the world.
3.	**Duty**. Pay a debt or keep a vow.

At the end of each session of play or when the GM says to do so, award yourself 1, 2, or 3 Experience Points (XP) according to how much progress you made toward your goal.

* **1 XP**: Limited, well below expectations.
* **2 XP**: Steady, on par with expectations.
* **3 XP**: Impressive, beyond expectations.

You start at Level 1 with 0 XP. When you reach Level 2 at 2 XP, Level 3 at 6 XP, and Level 4 at 12 XP, choose to either learn a new spell, increase your maximum HP by 1 and learn a new skill, or increase your maximum HP by 2.

## Retirement

You can retire from adventuring at any time. To determine the quality of your retirement, multiply your wealth in gold pieces by your level and find the result on the list below.

* **0 to 99**: Hard, miserable.
* **100 to 999**: Normal, modest.
* **1,000 to 9,999**: Easy, comfortable.
* **10,000 to 99,999**: Leader of a faction.
* **100,000 or more**: Leader of a realm.

(These values are compatible with adventures designed for standard old-school rulesets.)
