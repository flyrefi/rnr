# Enemy Rules

## Enemy Attacks

When enemies attack, the GM does not roll dice; instead, weak attacks deal 1 damage, normal attacks deal 2 damage, and strong attacks deal 3 damage. Boss enemies can attack twice with one action.

## Reactions and Morale

When you encounter a character for the first time, the GM rolls a d6; the higher the result, the friendlier they are. If an enemy is losing a fight, the GM rolls a d6; the higher the result, the greater the enemyâ€™s will to keep fighting.

In either case, if the result seems unlikely, the GM may roll a second d6 and take the new result if it seems more likely. The GM cannot roll a third d6.

## Attack Tags

1.	**Blast**: Strikes all targets within whatever area of effect the GM deems reasonable.
2.	**Body**: Strikes all targets that the attacker moves into or otherwise touches on its turn.
3.	**Drain**: Target gains no XP at the end of this session. If Level 4, target must retire.
4.	**Heavy**: Attack costs two actions: one to ready the attack and one to attack next turn.
5.	**Stun**: Target takes 1 damage if it moves and 1 damage if it acts on its next turn.
